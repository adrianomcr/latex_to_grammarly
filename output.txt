Given a normalized vector field B, the limit set at a point C, D, is the set of all different values the vector field E can have when we approach F for all the possible directions. That is, G, in which H is the set of directions J such that the limit exists. Use equation (1) to show the result in equation (4). The steps are presented in [1] and also in [2] 

It holds that

The proof is conclided by using result in (2) into (3).
